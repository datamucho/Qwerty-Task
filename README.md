# Qwerty-Task

Build binary tree algorithm with regular expresions

You are given a list of numbers stored in a list, A. Your challenge is to build a [Binary Search Tree] (Binary search tree - Wikipedia 898) to store these numbers. You will need to:

Represent each node of the tree (including its data, left child and right child).
Print the tree out in an understandable form.
Make a function to insert a list of numbers (A) into the tree.
Check if you can insert all the numbers in A into your tree, and that it prints out as expected.

Use the language of your choice to solve this challenge, but only submissions in languages taught by Codecademy are eligible to “win”.

Adapt your function to check if the tree is balanced so that it runs in O(n) time.
If your BST is balanced then the insert function would have only taken O(n log n) time, see if you can figure out why.
